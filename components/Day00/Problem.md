## Problem description

For this challenge, you're tasked with building a local two-player Tic Tac Toe game. Even though you probably know the overall gameplay and rules, I thought I'd give you a quick rundown anyway, just in case you needed it to better visualise or plan out a solution.

In Tic Tac Toe, two players take turns and place their symbols (ie. a circle and a cross) on a board, which consists of three rows with three cells each. The starting order can be decided randomly, it's really up to you. The first person to fill a row, or a column, or a diagonal exclusively with their symbol - wins. If nobody manages to do that, the game ends in a draw.
